Center cutout size is measured with a tape measure; may not be particularly accurate.
In particular the size of the fillet on the corners is only accurate to the "eyeball test".

The alignment between the top plate and the 80-20 on the Husky may be similarly incorrect.
Distance from the edge of the plate to the center of the mounting holes was measured, 
and then aligned on the center of the 80-20 at the rear of the Husky.
