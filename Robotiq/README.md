A custom fingertip for the Robotiq 3 finger gripper.
Roughness and teeth help grab soft objects and cloth.

The outward angle helps the teeth pull in cloth as the gripper closes.

Sometimes we don't want the adaptivity of the Robotiq 3 finger robotic gripper, so we made a splint to lock the fingers.
This is useful for pushing with partially open fingers in preparation for a pinch grasp. We made them specifically to improve grasping of cloth in a pile.

While we included screw holes, we have found the press fit sufficient for all applications.
